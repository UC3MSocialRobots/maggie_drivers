/**
 * @file        test_rs232.c
 * @brief       The test file for RS232.c.
 *
 *              You will need a serial port to test this library. The program tries to
 *              communicate through the serial port with a unit of the Faulhaber's
 *              MCDC3006S driver. For that reason, all the configurations are made in
 *              order to allow the communication with it.
 *
 *              If you want to communicate with other device (i.e. using minicom, etc.)
 *              you will have to configurate it in a proper way or modify the code of
 *              this file.
